<br/>

I am an associate professor at [University of Jinan](http://www.ujn.edu.cn/en/), and also a postdoctoral researcher at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu). I got my PhD in Computer Science at Shandong University in 2016, where I was advised by Prof. Qiuliang Xu.

My research interests include information security and applied cryptography. Recently, I am focusing on practical secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, and privacy-preserving data analysis.

<span style="color:red;">I am looking for highly motivated graduate students to join us on exciting information security projects! Please feel free to email your CV, TRANSCRIPTS, and PUBLICATIONS to ist.ujn(at)gmail.com for CSC Scholarship and Shandong Provincial Scholarship opportunities. </span>
